# RunItUp

An interactive-map application that lets sports enthusiasts schedule and join pick up games around their location. This project was inspired by college students'
love for pickup sports, both at a casual and competitive level. One of the most unique aspects about our app is that it is crowdsourced with the help of the Google
Maps API, and when a user searches for courts in a new location those results will be permanently saved into our database. At the current version, we support searches
and events for: basketball courts, volleyball courts, soccer fields, and tennis courts.

Host a new pickup event, or hop in to another activity where ever, whenever, with RunItUp!
